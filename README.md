# Pneumonia Detection Using Neural Networks

## Overview

The **Pneumonia Detection** project leverages **Deep Learning** and **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. The model is trained to classify images into two categories: **Pneumonia** and **Normal**. This project uses pre-trained models such as **Xception**, **VGG19**, and **CNN** to achieve high accuracy in detecting pneumonia.

## Technologies Used

- **Python** for backend implementation
- **TensorFlow** for training and evaluating deep learning models
- **Keras** for implementing pre-trained models (Xception, VGG19)
- **OpenCV** for image processing
- **Matplotlib** for visualizations
- **NumPy** for numerical operations
- **Pandas** for data handling

## Features

- **Image Classification**: Classify X-ray images into two categories (Pneumonia or Normal).
- **Model Comparison**: Evaluate the performance of multiple models (CNN, Xception, VGG19).
- **High Accuracy**: Achieved high accuracy with pre-trained models like Xception (98.8%).

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Bovollakrishnachaitanya/Pneumonia-Detection.git
   cd Pneumonia-Detection
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   
   - For **Windows**:
   
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - For **Mac/Linux**:
   
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset of chest X-ray images in the specified format.
2. Run the `train.py` script to train the models:

   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

3. To test the model on a new X-ray image, use the `predict.py` script:

   ```bash
   python predict.py --image_path path_to_your_image
   ```

4. The script will output the classification result (Pneumonia or Normal).

## Model Accuracy

The following models were evaluated:

- **CNN**: 96.16% accuracy
- **Xception**: 98.80% accuracy
- **VGG19**: 93.85% accuracy

The **Xception** model showed the best performance, achieving an accuracy of 98.80%.
